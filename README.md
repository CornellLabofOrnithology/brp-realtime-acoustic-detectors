# Realtime Acoustic Detectors for the RADd System

The Realtime Acoustic Detection daemon (RADd) provides a framework for applying acoustic detection and classification algorithms to a near-realtime stream of audio.  It has been designed to run on debian linux or derivatives, specifically targetting [Gumstix](https://www.gumstix.com/) and [Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspbian.org/).

## Documentation
Documentation covers the configuration of hardware, writing of a detector/classifier and examining output.  It can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/CornellLabofOrnithology/brp-realtime-acoustic-detectors/wiki)

## Examples
Each folder contains a different example detector/classifier algorithm for use with RADd.

## Origins
The RADd system (see [run_detect](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6107182)) was developed by the Bioacoustic Reasearch Program, within the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, by Eric Spaulding, [Matt Robbins](https://github.com/matt-robbins) and Sam Fladung.

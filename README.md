brp-realtime-acoustic-detectors
===============================

Each folder contains a different example detector/classifier algorithm for use with CLO-BRP's Realtime Acoustic Detection daemon (RADd).


##### Origins
The RADd system (see [run_detect](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6107182)) was developed by the Bioacoustic Reasearch Program, within the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, by Eric Spaulding, [Matt Robbins](https://github.com/matt-robbins) and Sam Fladung.
